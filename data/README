CMN065 : E12.5 vTC Input
CMN066 : E12.5 vTC REST ChIP

Initial datafiles from GIS were 

CMN065_vTC_input_s_7_export.zip
CMN066_vTC_Mash-1_s_8_export.zip

Totally failed to align to mouse genome. Further investigation revealed that they aligned well to the 
human genome, suggesting a mix up of files somewhere. Asked GIS to check and resend files.

Received new files from Irene Askoy (askoyi@gis.a-star.edu.sg) on 06/04/2011 however there seems to 
be some kind of confusion as we have received 2 files for each lane. They are not simple duplicates
as the file sizes differ. 

Irene thinks that these files are the originals:

CMN065_s_7_export.zip
CMN066_s_8_export.zip


And these files are the results of a second run:

CMN065_export.zip
CMN066_export.zip
